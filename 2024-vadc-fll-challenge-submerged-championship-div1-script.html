<h1>2024 Virginia DC Regional Championship Tournament Closing Ceremony</h1>
<p style="background-color:magenta;"><b>Barry: </b>Welcome to the 2024 Virginia DC Regional Championship Tournament! Today, we are here to celebrate the achievements of the FIRST<sup>&#174;</sup> LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> League Challenge teams that are here! Please turn your attention to [area where teams are] as we celebrate each team with the Parade of Teams!</p>

<h2>Parade of Teams</h2>
<p><i>The Emcee can announce each team as they move through a line of volunteers to receive their tournament ribbons. You might want to funnel them into a "reserved for teams" seating area in the stands.</i></p>

<h2>After Parade of Teams</h2>
<p style="background-color:aqua;"><b>Andrew: </b>We started this tournament with a shared mission: to innovate, to learn, and to celebrate the SUBMERGED season. Every single team brought something special, and we've seen amazing robots, brilliant solutions, and above all, incredible teamwork. Today, each of you has embodied the values of FIRST LEGO League: discovery, impact, inclusion, innovation, teamwork, and fun!</p>

<p style="background-color:magenta;"><b>Barry: </b>Teams - Congratulations on a great season! The journey that got you to this point defines each one of you as a FIRST LEGO League Challenge champion and winner, and this tournament ribbon celebrates this achievement.</p>


<p style="background-color:yellow;"><b>Kaitlin:</b> Join me in welcoming some very special guests: TBD</p>


<p style="background-color:aqua;"><b>Andrew: </b>We want to thank our FIRST<sup>&#174;</sup> LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> League Global Sponsors, LEGO Education and The LEGO Foundation, in addition to Rockwell Automation, our Division Sponsor.

<h2>Volunteer Award</h2>
<p style="background-color:magenta;"><b>Barry: </b>Before we get to the team awards, we want to take a moment to recognize our volunteers. Volunteers, please stand and wave to the crowd! Teams, please give a round of applause for our volunteers. No words can adequately express our appreciation for you. </p>

<p style="background-color:aqua;"><b>Andrew: </b>No tournament can happen without the support, time, and commitment of our volunteers. At every tournament, there are those individuals who are the "go-to" people, the "make it happen" people, the "there is no such word as impossible" people.</p>

<p style="background-color:magenta;"><b>Barry: </b>Our first award goes to just such a person - a person who put in that extra hour, lost that extra sleep, was there when everyone else had gone home.</p>

<p style="background-color:yellow;"><b>Kaitlin:</b> This person Quickly helped with setup, and takedown.</p>

<p style="background-color:yellow;"><b>Kaitlin:</b> The Volunteer Award goes to: Flash</p>

<h2>Coach Recognition</h2>
<p style="background-color:aqua;"><b>Andrew: </b>Coaches and mentors, please stand. These are the special volunteers who have spent hours each week with the teams. They have inspired, encouraged, and motivated, all the while demonstrating and modeling <i>Gracious Professionalism</i><sup>&#174;</sup>. Teams, take a moment to tell your coaches how much you appreciate all they have done for you.</p>
